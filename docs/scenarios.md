# Scenarios

This document categorizes guidance based on the following scenarios:

{.glossary}
Baseline
: Every federation operator, participant, or service should meet these
  standards.  Anonymous, affiliation-only access is supported, but
  user identification may not always be possible.

{.glossary}
Pseudonymous
: Not every service provider needs (or wants) to handle personal data,
  and identity providers have a duty of care for their users' privacy.
  Guidance in this category facilitates use cases that include
  privacy-preserving personalization, etc.

{.glossary}
Attributable
: Some services must hold their users accountable for their actions
  within the system, which requires assurances that personal data used
  for identification, authorization, and accounting is correct,
  complete, and well-protected.
