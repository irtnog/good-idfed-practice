# FM-01 Federation Metadata

## Guideline

1. Permit users to authenticate using any trusted identity provider;
   and
2. Configure identity provider and service provider trust
   relationships using: [Assignment: federation-defined metadata
   distributions]:
    1. Validate metadata distributions using: [Assignment:
       federation-defined signatures]; and
    2. Require metadata distributions include expiration dates/times;
       and
    3. Invalidate cached metadata distributions: [Assignment:
       federation-defined expiration threshold]; and
    4. Update cached metadata every: [Assignment: federation-defined
       time period].

## Discussion

TODO: Whatâ€™s multilateral federation?  Why?  Keywords: scaling,
dynamic recognition of new services or identity providers, graceful
management of change like rekeying.  Note usefulness in bi-lateral
interactions.  Give tangible examples.
