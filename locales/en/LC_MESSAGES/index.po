"Validating an identity provider or service provider deployment presents a"
" significant roadblock for people who have never used federated "
"identities before.  Current good practice involves an overwhelming "
"variety of standards, expectations, entity categories, frameworks, "
"profiles, and more.  There exists no single, comprehensive resource for "
"operational guidance and integration testing.  What documentation or test"
" resources exist are difficult to find even for experienced "
"professionals, are typically restricted to federation members, and are "
"focused almost exclusively on identity providers. While the decentralized"
" nature of identity federation allows it to scale far beyond current "
"commercial offerings, that same decentralization makes enacting "
"meaningful change to participant or federation operations seemingly "
"impossible.  A scorecard would be a powerful tool for change."
